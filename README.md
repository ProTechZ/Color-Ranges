# Color-Ranges
##### This is a pretty simple project of mine. It was just a time passer.

How Color Ranges work is that it shows you how the grayscale range looks like. From black to grey to white. It progresses in 100 stages.
There is a button that will change the screen to an RGB scale and colour picker.
