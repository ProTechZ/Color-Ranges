# Color-Ranges 💯💯
---
Color Ranges is a very simple project and was really just an experiment. It basically shows you what the grayscale range looks like - from black to grey to white. It progresses in 100 stages.

The original inspiration 💡 for this project was when I was working on a Flutter app 📱 and I used a gradient from black ⬛ to white ⬜. I was reminded of the grayscale range, and immediately wondered what the in-between greys looked like and decided to create a website 🖥️ to display the range in 100 stages. I chose 100 because it's just such a complete number 😁
